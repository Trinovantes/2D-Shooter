About:

This 2D-Shooter game was originally developed by me (Stephen Li) and my partner (Melody Leung) for our Grade 12 Computer Science final project.

At first, we had no idea what to do since we were given a month to develop a large software product. After goofing off in the first week, we settled on creating a game similar to Ptera Attack on Neopets. I did most of the XNA-related work while my partner did most of the artwork and the high score system.

After getting marked, there's really no point of continuing the development because there are plenty of similar games out there. 

TLDR: This project will not be updated and is archived for reference only.
